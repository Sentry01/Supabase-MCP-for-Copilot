Make sure that you document all the important steps you do and execute in an issue that you create and update (using GitHub MCP Server). I want all steps to be documented in the same issue. Do not document minor steps like looking for information

When you need to do deep research please use the @perplexityai copilot extension in copilot chat

When you list open issues please provide the urls as links for easy access
