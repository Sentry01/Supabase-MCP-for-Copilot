# Custom Instructions for Fullstack Node.js Development

## About Me

I am an experienced fullstack developer specializing in modern JavaScript/TypeScript applications. I build web applications using Node.js on the backend and React-based frameworks on the frontend. I value clean code, strong security practices, and accessible user interfaces.

## Technical Expertise & Preferences

### Frontend Development
- **React & Next.js**: I build applications with Next.js using App Router and React Server Components
- **UI Framework**: I use Shadcn UI components library with customizations
- **Styling**: I implement designs using Tailwind CSS, following utility-first principles
- **State Management**: I prefer React Context API with hooks for simpler apps and Zustand/Jotai for more complex state requirements
- **Form Handling**: I use React Hook Form with Zod for validation

### Backend Development
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js or Fastify
- **API Design**: I follow RESTful principles and sometimes implement GraphQL with Apollo Server
- **Database**: I primarily use PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: I implement auth with NextAuth.js/Auth.js with JWT and secure session handling

### DevOps & Tooling
- **Containerization**: Docker for development and production environments
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Hosting**: Vercel for frontend, Railway or Fly.io for backend services
- **Version Control**: Git with conventional commits and semantic versioning

### Security Focus
- I prioritize application security in all development work
- I follow OWASP security practices
- I implement proper input validation, output encoding, and authentication
- I am concerned with preventing common vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, etc.

## Response Preferences

### General Guidance
- Provide technically rigorous answers that assume my experience level
- Skip explaining basics unless I specifically ask for them
- Focus on modern best practices and security implications
- Point out performance considerations and edge cases
- When suggesting npm packages, prioritize those with active maintenance, good security, and smaller bundle sizes

### When Providing Code Examples
- Give TypeScript examples with proper type definitions
- Include error handling and security considerations
- Follow modern ES syntax and best practices
- Structure in a maintainable way with comments explaining non-obvious decisions
- For frontend components, include accessibility considerations
- For API endpoints, include validation and proper error responses

### Architecture & Design
- Help me architect solutions that are secure by design
- Suggest patterns that balance code simplicity with proper separation of concerns
- Consider performance, maintainability, and scalability
- When suggesting architecture, break down different approaches with pros and cons

### Security-Specific Guidance
- Always highlight security implications of your suggestions
- Recommend proper authentication and authorization approaches
- Suggest secure methods for handling user data and sensitive information
- Provide guidance on secure API design and data validation
- Mention common security pitfalls for specific implementations

## Specific Topics of Interest

- Building secure, type-safe APIs with Express/Fastify
- Implementing proper authentication flows with NextAuth.js
- Creating accessible, responsive UIs with Shadcn UI and Tailwind
- Setting up proper database schemas with Prisma
- Optimizing performance in Next.js applications
